To whomever it may concern,

Thank you for coming to look at my repository. I have projects I worked on here during my undergraduate degree at 
the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. There is a total of 4 research projects that I have listed. I will give a 
summary of them so that you can understand the project before you view them.

1. Wooly Mammoth Genome Reconstruction
2. Air Pollution Data Analysis
3. Staged Auto Accident Fraud
4. Steroid Era MLB Player Analysis

The first project was intended to look at the process of reconstructing the wooly mammoth Genome. Wooly mammoth DNA 
is typically preserved in a frozen state and due to the numerous years, the DNA has undergone significant damage. This project
was designed to develop different functions using Python code to help parse and process the DNA to reach a point of reconstruction.
We explained the functions we created in this document to be expanded on in further areas of study not limited to the wooly mammoth.
This project was done using Python.

The second project was intended to look into the global environmental issue of air pollution. The dataset was provided by the Beijing 
Multi-Site Air-Quality Data which was published in the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The dataset is documented from March 1st, 2013
to February 28th, 2017, and contains 420768 observations. The numerous analyses we conducted were all centered around the idea
of observing how air pollutants act within our environment. Files "FinalProjectCodeQ...", "Graph 1-8 Analysis STAT 448", and "9-16 Analysis" 
are the SAS work files done during the research/work period. This project was done using SAS. 

The third project was intended to look at insurance claims after getting into car accidents, and whether or not such claims were fraudulent. 
The project mainly consisted of sorting and testing data that will be useful in understanding if there are any inherent characteristics regarding 
an accident that make certain drivers, cars, situations, etc. more prone to insurance claim fraud. This project was done using Python.


The fourth project was intended to look at the effects of steroids in major league baseball. The "Steroid Era" of the MLB lasted from
1994-2004 where the batting and pitching stats of players across many teams were greatly enhanced. More detail about the project can be found
in the "about_page.RMD" file or in the application itself underneath the About tab. This project was done using a shiny app in RStudio.

Thank you for taking the time to read this document. Feel free to reach me at the email listed in my profile for any follow-up questions.
